## Background and motivation
iFullerton app requires the user to log into their CSUF campus ID for full use of their features and the guest version does not include food, amenities, or a detailed campus map. Our goal is to deliver a intuitive and seamless app for CSUF students and guests. The app shall have a comprehensive list of food places, activities, and map levels of CSUF. 

### Summary
The app shall be an iOS app that allows users to conveniently access food, amenities, and classroom locations on CSUF. The app shall be free for everyone. The app shall not require log-in or authentication. The app targeted users are everyone who visits CSUF (students, staff, guests).

## Features
Only 4 features need to be implemented.
Note: Some feature are more complex/bigger in size compared to others. 

1. Developer Name | GPS tracking: This feature is to provide location tracking of the user to provide recommendations closest to their location and their location on the map. Placeholder can be use until the developer learn how to implement GPS. Since this is an iOS app, Apple map will be use.

2. David Santana | Food/Reviews: This feature is to provide a list of food and amenities location and their location on the CSUF campus map. Some food places are Carl's Jr., Panda Express, Starbucks, etc. This feature is to add reviews from two main sources, Google reviews and Yelp reviews. The display can be side by side like: [Google Reviews] ✰✰✰✰✰    [Yelp Reviews] ✰✰✰✰✰. The users shall be able to click onto the reviews and be redirected to their respective review sites (even if they don't have any reviews).

3. Minh Nguyen | Map and levels: This feature is to provide the app with a map of CSUF. The map shall include all the levels of each building and all the rooms in each level. (Start with ECS/CS buildings first)

4. Nhan Mac | Search and Preferences: This feature is to provide users with a pleasant experience when using the app. Some options are search function, light/dark mode, accessibility options, etc.

5. David Santana | Amenities/Reviews: This feature is to provide a list of the anemities CSUF offers. Some amenities are TSU, gym, bookstore, etc. The basic information shall include menu/anemity's website link, operation hours, and description of the place (more info are always welcome).

6. Developer Name | Expanded options beyond CSUF: Some food and amenities places are very close to CSUF but it is not part of the campus. These places includes PLAYlive Nation, 85 degrees, Target, etc. These extra info can be added to their respective features to make the app more "featureful". The expanded area should be kept to walkable distance (Anything across the street from CSUF).
