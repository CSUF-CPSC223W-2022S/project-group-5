## Background and motivation
Social media is a part of our daily lives. The world is happening at a rapid rate and social media allows us to be connected to the world. Reddit and its sub-forums provide us with news, memes, tutorials, etc. We want to make an app that allows for easier access to Reddit while being simple and intuitive, especially for users browsing on their phones.
